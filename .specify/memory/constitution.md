# H53 Constitution

## Core Principles

### P1. Library-First Delivery
- MUST implement every feature as a standalone library with a clear interface before adding orchestration layers.
- MUST declare library dependencies explicitly and keep them acyclic; shared utilities live in purpose-built modules.
- SHOULD expose configuration as library parameters instead of relying on global state or side effects.
Rationale: Modular libraries allow reuse, simplify reasoning, and make downstream tooling (CLI, tasks) predictable.

### P2. CLI Boundary Contracts
- MUST expose supported operations through documented CLI commands that read from stdin/args and write deterministic stdout/stderr outputs.
- MUST provide both human-readable and machine-consumable (JSON) output formats for each command.
- SHOULD keep CLI flags stable; breaking changes require a migration note in the plan/tasks flow.
Rationale: A CLI-first boundary ensures automation friendliness and keeps the human experience consistent.

### P3. Test-Driven Proof
- MUST write failing unit or contract tests before implementation, following a Red-Green-Refactor loop.
- MUST keep tests authoritative: when behavior changes, tests change in the same pull request.
- SHOULD pair every new library surface with contract and regression coverage.
Rationale: TDD enforces intent clarity and prevents regressions as the system grows.

### P4. Integration Evidence
- MUST create integration tests whenever a library contract changes or multiple modules collaborate.
- MUST document integration coverage gaps in the plan’s Constitution Check until resolved.
- SHOULD maintain reproducible fixtures and avoid network or external service flakiness.
Rationale: Integration signals reveal boundary failures that unit tests alone miss.

### P5. Operational Observability
- MUST emit structured logs, metrics, or traces for every CLI command and critical library path.
- MUST define failure handling strategies (retries, fallbacks) as part of implementation tasks.
- SHOULD add lightweight health checks for long-running processes or services.
Rationale: Observability guarantees post-deployment diagnosability and responsible operations.

## Quality Standards

- Security reviews are required for changes touching data persistence, authentication, or secrets.
- Documentation updates (READMEs, quickstarts) accompany user-visible behavior changes.
- Accessibility and usability considerations are captured in specs for any interface work.
- Performance targets must be stated and validated when latency or throughput is a concern.

## Development Workflow

1. Draft a feature specification that captures user scenarios, testable requirements, and open questions.
2. Generate an implementation plan that records Constitution Check findings before and after design.
3. Produce contracts, data models, and quickstart guides before writing production code.
4. Create tasks that enforce TDD ordering, integration coverage, and observability work items.
5. Keep progress tracking artifacts up to date; unresolved deviations require explicit justification.

## Governance

- The constitution supersedes other process documents; conflicts resolve in favor of this document.
- Amendments require proposal, reviewer sign-off, and updates to dependent templates in the same change.
- Versioning follows semantic rules (MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new guidance, PATCH for clarifications).
- Compliance is reviewed at plan creation, post-design, and before release sign-off.
