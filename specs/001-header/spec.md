# Feature Specification: Global Cabin Header

**Feature Branch**: `001-header`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a global header for my page. It should have a H53 logo, links to \"articles\" and \"guestbook\", weather status from yr.no and clerk login/profile button. It should collapse to a burger menu on smaller screens."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üîí Assume cabin features are member-only; explicitly call out if a public experience is required.

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated H53 cabin member, I want a consistent site-wide header so that I can quickly navigate to articles, review the guestbook, see the current cabin weather, and manage my account from any page.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated H53 member on any page, **When** the page renders, **Then** the header displays the H53 logo, navigation links to articles and guestbook, the latest yr.no weather snapshot, and the Clerk profile button.
2. **Given** an authenticated member viewing the site on a viewport below the defined breakpoint, **When** they tap the burger menu, **Then** the navigation links expand in an accessible overlay or drawer while the weather badge and Clerk controls remain reachable.
3. **Given** an authenticated member already located on the homepage (`/`), **When** they click the H53 logo, **Then** the page does not reload and focus remains on the current view.

### Edge Cases
- Weather service unreachable: show a "Weather unavailable" fallback without breaking layout.
- Weather cache stale or missing: trigger a fresh fetch while keeping UI responsive.
- Member not authenticated: enforce Clerk sign-in gate before header content renders.
- Extremely small screens (<320px): navigation collapses without truncating critical actions.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST present a persistent header component on all authenticated pages containing the H53 logo, articles link, guestbook link, weather summary, and Clerk user button.
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch the current yr.no snapshot via the existing weather integration and render temperature plus condition.
- **FR-003**: System MUST collapse navigation links behind an accessible burger menu at the Tailwind `md` breakpoint or below while keeping account access visible.
- **FR-004**: System MUST cache the weather snapshot using Next.js data caching (e.g., `fetch` with `revalidate: 3600` or `React.cache`) so the value persists for roughly one hour without writing to Convex.
- **FR-005**: System MUST surface a graceful fallback message when the weather snapshot request fails or times out.
- **FR-006**: System MUST log weather fetch failures and menu toggle errors via the shared logging utilities for observability.
- **FR-007**: System MUST keep the header sticky at the top of the viewport across all device sizes so navigation, weather, and account controls remain visible during scroll.
- **FR-008**: System MUST present the mobile burger menu using a shadcn drawer that fills the viewport below the sticky header, provides accessible focus trapping/ESC dismissal, and exposes the articles and guestbook links alongside the weather badge and account controls.
- **FR-009**: System MUST display the weather temperature in Celsius only, rounding to one decimal place, alongside the weather condition text.
- **FR-010**: System MUST link the H53 logo to the homepage (`/`) but suppress navigation when the current route is already `/` to avoid unnecessary reloads.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- No new persistent entities are introduced; the feature consumes existing weather helpers and relies on Next.js request caching rather than Convex storage.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: To confirm the navigation experience: should the global header stay visible while members scroll? ‚Üí A: Keep the header sticky at the top on all viewports
- Q: When the burger menu opens on small screens, how should it present the navigation? ‚Üí A: Full-screen overlay that slides in from the right
- Q: How should we present the weather measurement? ‚Üí A: Display temperature in Celsius only
- Q: What should happen when members click the H53 logo while already on the homepage? ‚Üí A: Do nothing when already on `/`
