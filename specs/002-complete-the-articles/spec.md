# Feature Specification: Complete the Articles Page

**Feature Branch**: `[002-complete-the-articles]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Complete the articles page. These should be local markdown files in the repository for a simple blog-like feature to begin with, do not use convex. They should be rendered as static content preferably for performance. Keep in min that the header is dynamic with weather and login state. Use tailwind typography for styling."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üîí Assume cabin features are member-only; explicitly call out if a public experience is required.

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28

- Q: When no articles are available, what experience should the member have on the Articles page? ‚Üí A: Show an empty-state card with messaging and a link back to the homepage
- Q: What should happen if the Articles list references a markdown file that cannot be read during build? ‚Üí A: Fail the build/release until the file is fixed
- Q: If the weather service is unavailable when loading the Articles page, what should the header display? ‚Üí A: Error icon with popover message
- Q: How should the Articles list be ordered by default? ‚Üí A: Manual order defined in metadata
- Q: Which metadata fields must be present for an article to appear in the Articles listing? ‚Üí A: Title and publish date only

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A signed-in member navigates to the Articles page to read curated editorial content that deepens their connection to the product and provides timely information without waiting for remote content loads.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a signed-in member with network access, **When** they open the Articles page, **Then** they see a list of available articles with titles, short summaries, and publish dates sourced from the in-product content library, and can open any article to read the full content in the same session.
2. **Given** an unauthenticated visitor who attempts to access the Articles page, **When** the system confirms they are not signed in, **Then** the page presents a clear instruction to sign in along with the standard header that reflects their logged-out state.

### Edge Cases
- Build MUST fail when the Articles list references a markdown file that is missing or unreadable so the issue can be fixed before release.
- If the weather service is unavailable, the header shows an error icon with a popover message explaining that live weather data cannot load.
- When no articles are published, show an empty-state card with supportive messaging and a link back to the homepage.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an Articles page that is reachable from the authenticated navigation once a member signs in.
- **FR-002**: System MUST present a scannable list of articles, each showing title and publish date derived from the curated article source files, arranged according to the manual order set in article metadata, with optional summary copy when provided.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow members to open and read the full text of any article from the list within a branded article layout optimized for long-form reading.
- **FR-004**: System MUST load article listings and full content directly from locally stored markdown documents bundled with the site so that no external database or Convex dependency is required for initial publication.
- **FR-005**: System MUST render article bodies using the product's rich typography styling to ensure readability, consistent spacing, and hierarchy across headings, paragraphs, lists, and inline elements.
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure the global header on the Articles page continues to surface live weather information and, when the weather service is unavailable, displays an error icon with a popover message explaining that live weather data cannot load while still reflecting the visitor's sign-in state.
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a graceful fallback message whenever an article cannot be loaded or the article collection is empty, guiding the member on what to expect next; the empty-state MUST include a card with supportive messaging and a link back to the homepage when no articles are available, and the build MUST fail if an article file cannot be read so the release does not ship with missing content.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Article**: Represents a single piece of editorial content including title, publish date, optional summary, author attribution (if provided), and body copy sourced from the local markdown file; establishes whether it should appear in the Articles page listing.
- **Article Listing**: Represents the ordered collection of Articles exposed on the Articles page, respecting the manual ordering defined within article metadata, including any grouping rules and the empty-state messaging when no items are available.
