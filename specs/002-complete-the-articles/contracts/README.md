# Contracts Summary

No new external APIs, Convex functions, or webhook handlers are introduced for this feature. All article data is sourced from repository markdown files at build time, and the existing weather helper remains the sole integration. Input validation responsibilities are documented in the data model (Zod schemas for frontmatter and weather union types).
