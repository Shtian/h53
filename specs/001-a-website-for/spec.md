# Feature Specification: H53 Family Cabin Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-website-for`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A website for my family's cabin, abbreviated H53. Users should be able to log in. My family should be able to post pictures with texts, as a guestbook feature. There should be a page about general information articles on usage and maintenance. General weather info should be available in the header."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Present a public landing experience for visitors with cabin name (H53) and live weather summary in the header.
2. Offer authentication so authorized family members can sign in before accessing contribution tools.
3. Enable signed-in family members to create, edit, and remove guestbook posts that combine photos with accompanying text captions.
4. Allow signed-in family members to browse guestbook entries in chronological order with clear attribution and timestamps.
5. Provide a dedicated information section where maintenance and usage articles can be browsed by category and detail page.
6. Surface a persistent weather widget in the site header that presents the latest snapshot retrieved from the yr.no weather service for coordinates 61°10'31.9"N 10°37'55.5"E.
7. Present clear messaging when sessions expire and return users to the landing experience without exposing editing controls to unauthenticated visitors.

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Prioritize family-friendly tone and simplicity suited for mixed-ability relatives.
- ✅ Keep guestbook contributions respectful and tied to cabin memories or updates.
- ❌ Do not expose editing controls or private content to unauthenticated visitors.

### Section Requirements
- Landing content, guestbook, information articles, and weather header are mandatory site sections.
- Authentication flows and content management tools apply only to authorized family members.

### For AI Generation
- Capture unanswered questions as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] to be resolved before implementation.
- Avoid prescribing specific technologies, hosting providers, or APIs.
- Assume weather data uses the yr.no API, media uploads cap at 4MB (JPG, PNG, WebP, AVIF), and Clerk handles self-service provisioning for family members.

## Assumptions & Dependencies

- Weather data depends on the yr.no API; when unavailable the header MUST display a friendly fallback message with the last successful timestamp.
- Guestbook media storage relies on infrastructure that enforces the 4MB cap and the preferred image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP, AVIF).
- Family members self-manage profile details; no administrator approval workflow is required.
- TailwindCSS customization stays within CSS-first configuration (e.g., `@config` directives in `globals.css`); no standalone `tailwind.config` file is maintained.
- The weather widget queries yr.no using the cabin's coordinates (latitude 61.17553°N, longitude 10.63208°E).

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: Which yr.no location identifier should the weather widget use for the cabin? → A: 61°10'31.9"N 10°37'55.5"E

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an H53 family member, I want to log in to the cabin website so I can post photo updates and read shared memories alongside current cabin information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a signed-in family member, **When** I create a guestbook post with a photo and caption, **Then** it appears to other authenticated relatives.
2. **Given** I am an unauthenticated visitor, **When** I attempt to open a protected route (guestbook, articles, or dashboard), **Then** I am redirected to the landing page and prompted to log in.
3. **Given** I am signed in and active, **When** I refresh a protected page, **Then** the experience loads without requiring a second login.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when weather data cannot be retrieved from the yr.no provider?
- How does the system handle photo uploads that exceed the maximum supported size or file type?
- What experience is shown when there are no guestbook entries yet?
- How does the site handle expired sessions when users attempt to post or edit content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The site MUST display the H53 brand and a weather summary in the header on every page.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST authenticate family members before granting access to contribution tools.
- **FR-002a**: All routes except the public landing page MUST require a signed-in Clerk session; `/`, `/api/health`, and static assets remain public, everything else returns a redirect-to-login for anonymous visitors.
- **FR-003**: Authenticated family members MUST be able to create guestbook entries containing at least one photo and descriptive text.
- **FR-004**: The guestbook MUST present entries to signed-in family members in chronological order with author attribution and timestamps.
- **FR-005**: The site MUST provide a section of general information articles covering cabin usage and maintenance guidance.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST allow authorized users to edit or remove their own guestbook entries.
- **FR-007**: Weather data MUST refresh at least every 6 hours using the yr.no API so the header reflects current cabin conditions.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST notify users when uploads exceed 4MB or use unsupported formats and explain accepted formats (JPG, PNG, WebP, AVIF).
- **FR-009**: The site MUST provide an accessible navigation structure so visitors can reach guestbook, information articles, and login from any page.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Family Member Account**: Represents an authorized user; attributes include name, email/username, display name, optional profile image, and timestamps.
- **Guestbook Entry**: Captures photo(s), caption text, author, visibility status, timestamps (created/updated), and optional tags (e.g., season, event).
- **Information Article**: Contains title, summary, full text, categories (usage, maintenance, safety), author/last updated metadata, optional attachments, and publish status.
- **Weather Snapshot**: Stores temperature, conditions description, retrieval timestamp, data source (yr.no), and expiry time.
