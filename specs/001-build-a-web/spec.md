# Feature Specification: H53 Family Cabin Portal

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-web`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a web page for my cabin, abbreviated h53. My whole family should be able to log in and view it. It has an album feature with images, titles and timestamps. It should also have a handbook page, with a list of articles."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A family member logs into the H53 portal, views the latest cabin updates, browses the shared photo album with captions and timestamps, and reads reference material in the handbook section.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a family member with valid credentials, **When** they log into the portal, **Then** they can access the home page that links to album and handbook content.
2. **Given** an authenticated family member, **When** they open the album feature, **Then** they can view image entries showing the photo, its title, and the capture/upload timestamp in chronological order.
3. **Given** an authenticated family member, **When** they navigate to the handbook, **Then** they see a list of articles with titles and summaries and can open each article for full content.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an unauthenticated visitor attempts to access the portal or album pages?
- How does the system handle missing metadata on an album entry (e.g., no timestamp provided)?
- What occurs if the handbook contains no articles or an article is unpublished?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The portal MUST restrict access to authenticated family members via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specify authentication method and credential management].
- **FR-002**: After successful authentication, the system MUST present a landing page that highlights the cabin (H53) identity and provides navigation to album and handbook sections.
- **FR-003**: The album feature MUST display each entry with an image, title, and timestamp, ordered by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm desired sort order‚Äînewest first or chronological].
- **FR-004**: Family members MUST be able to open an album entry to view a larger image and extended description or metadata if available.
- **FR-005**: The handbook section MUST list available articles with titles and brief summaries, allowing users to open and read the full article content.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST define who can add or update album entries and handbook articles [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: identify admin/editor roles and workflow].
- **FR-007**: The portal MUST log access attempts and authentication failures for security auditing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: determine retention period and visibility].
- **FR-008**: The system SHOULD support responsive layouts so family members can access the portal on desktop and mobile devices.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **FamilyMember**: Represents an individual with portal access; attributes include name, contact info, credential status, and role (viewer/admin) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: role taxonomy].
- **AlbumEntry**: Contains an image asset reference, title, description, timestamp (capture or upload), and author/uploader.
- **HandbookArticle**: Holds title, summary, full content, publish date, and last-updated metadata; may include author attribution and tags.
